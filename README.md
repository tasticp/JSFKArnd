**How it works:**
- The first line displays a header image that links to your GitHub profile.
- The second line shows your recently played Spotify tracks (replace `your_spotify_username` with your actual Spotify username).
- The third line displays your GitHub stats card (replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and customize the theme if you wish)[1][2][5].

**Tips:**
- Make sure your image links are publicly accessible.
- You can edit your README.md directly from your GitHub profile repository[2].
- For more customization, check the documentation of the GitHub Readme Stats project[1].

This structure is commonly used in many popular GitHub profile READMEs and is a great way to showcase your activity and stats[5].
